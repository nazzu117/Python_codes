## Why is python
"""
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

 ---> python is a general purpose programming language[a language is suitable for developing any kind of applications like web app,Automation app,Data Science ,ML,Big Data,Animation,Gaming applications ....]
    ---> Multi programming paradigm
    ---> High level language[1.Human understandable,Portable,Machine independent]
    ---> Interpreted -- Line by line excution
    ---> User friendly prgmming lng --Statements like normal english statements

It is used for:
web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.
    """
## How python was built..?
""" it has taken adventages from different prgming languages such as:
1.Procedural oriented programming languages:Ex:- C Language-- Functions
2.Object oriented programming languages:    Ex:- C++ ,Java -- Security ,Reusablity,Flexibility
3.Scripting language :                      Ex:- Dynamic Datatypes 
4.Modular programming :                     Ex:- Modules

## why python super popular..?
"""
The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and 
not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. Due to its ease of learning and usage, 
python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages.

## Flavors of Python:-
"""
Types of Python compilers are referred as flavors of Python. They help to integrate various types of 
programming languages in Python some of them are:

1. CPython:

It is a Python compiler that was implemented in C language. Even C++ code can be execute using CPython.

2. JPython:

It is enables Python implementation to be run on Java platform. It runs on JVM.

3. IronPython:

It is compiler designed for .NET framework, but it is written in C#. It can run on CLR(Common Language Run time).

4. PyPy:

It is a Python implemented by using Python language itself. It runs fast since JIT is incorporated to PVM.

5. Ruby Python:

It acts as a bridge from Ruby to Python interpreter. It embeds the Python interpreter inside the Ruby application

6. Pythonxy:

It is written in the form of Python(X,Y). It is designed by adding scientific and engineering related packages.

7.Anaconda Python:

The name Anaconda Python is obtained after redeveloping it to handle large scale data 
processing, predictive analytics and scientific computing. It handles huge amount of data.

8. Stackless Python:

Tasklets are the small tasks that are run independently. The communication
 is done  with each by using channels. They schedule, control and suspend the tasklets. 
 Hundreds of tasklets can run by a thread. The thread and tasklets can be created in stackless python. 
 It is a re-implementation of python.   """
