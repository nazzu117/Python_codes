#Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For 
# example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers. Let's try to understand 
# why 153...... is an Armstrong number.


# Python program to check if the number provided by the user is an Armstrong number or not
# take input from the user
# num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# # initialize sum

# sum = 0
# # find the sum of the cube of each digit
# temp = num
# while temp > 0:
#     digit = temp % 10
#     sum += digit ** 3
#     temp //= 10
# # display the result
# if num == sum:
#     print(num,"is an Armstrong number")
# else:
#     print(num,"is not an Armstrong number")
