# There are three numeric types in Python:

# int
# float
# complex
# boolean

""" Type casting"""
# a=10 #intiger or int  are numerice type with out desimals, unlimited length. it can be of positive or negitive
# print(a)
# print(type(a))
# print(float(a))
# print(complex(a))
# print(bool(a))


# b=4.5 #float or floting point is a +ve or -ve contain one or more desimals
# # 4.4,4.0,5.5,-7.98
# print(b)
# print(type(b))
# print(complex(b))
# print(int(b))
# c=6j #complex is written as "j" imaginary part 
# #3+5j,4j,-3j ....
# print(c)
# print(type(c))


# x = print(float(1))     # x will be 1.0
# y = print(float(2.8))   # y will be 2.8
# z = print(float("3"))   # z will be 3.0
# w = print(float("4.2")) # w will be 4.2

# a=1234
# b=3452
# c=-34333
# print(a,b,c)

# a=10
# b=30
# print(a>b)       # boolean gives either True or False


# import decimal

# print(0.1) 

# print(decimal.decimal(0.1))

# from decimal import Decimal as D

# print(D('1.1') + D('2.2'))

# print(D('1.2') * D('2.50'))


"""Python Fractions
Python provides operations involving fractional numbers through its fractions module.

A fraction has a numerator and a denominator, both of which are integers. This module has support for rational number arithmetic.

We can create Fraction objects in various ways. Let's have a look at them."""

# import fractions

# print(fractions.Fraction(1.5))

# print(fractions.Fraction(5))

# print(fractions.Fraction(1,3))
