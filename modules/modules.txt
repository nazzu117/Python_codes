MODULES:- Every pyhon file or programme or python file is called MODULE

"""modules refers to a file containing python statements and definations
and the file refers example.py and here module would be example.

we use modules to breakdown large programmes into small manageable and organised files.
furthermore, modules provides reusability of code  

We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, 
instead of copying their definitions into different programs.
"""

Module consists of:-

1.Excuatable statements 
2.Global variables
3.Functions 
4.Classes

Main module:- if we excute any module,by default it is main module

we can import the properties of one module into another module using import statement

Sub module:- if a module imported another module ,then the imported model is called sub module.

      sample.py                       test.py
......................          .......................  If we execute test.py then test.py is main module and  
......................          .......................  sample.py is sub module
...................... -->import.......................
......................          .......................
......................          .......................


1) if we execute the main module(sample.py) then all the statements of sample.py will be converted into intermeadite 
   coad called as a byte code(sample.pyc), this byte code again converted into machine code is executed,once the 
   execution completed then the byte coad (sample.pyc) will be deleted automatically.

2) if we execute the main module(test.py) then two .pyc files will be generated for the main module and sub module
   respectively i.e, test.pyc and sample.pyc 
   if the sub module (sample.pyc) is already avilable it wont be generated again untill or unless if there a change in
   source coad of sample.py 
   once the execution completed then the main model.pyc will be deleted automatically where as sub-model remains 
   permanetly.. (sample.pyc)

3) if we excute Main module(test.py) for the 2nd time then only one .pyc gets generated i.e,main module test.pyc bcz
   sub module sample.pyc already avilable 

4) before executining the main module (test.py) for the 3rd time, if we modified the sample.py then 2 .pyc files gets
   created i.e, main module(test.pyc) and the updated module (sample.pyc)

5) if we executeda file then the all the Excuatable statements of the sub module also executed automatically.
