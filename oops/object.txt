OBJECT:- The concept allocating memory for non-static variable of the class at the time
         of the programme is known as a object.

Instance of a class is known as a object
Syntax of object:

refvariable=classname()    ## object creation statement
here refvariable stores the adress of the object(in-direct-adress)

Referance Variable :   whenever object is created ,that memory location 
  address of the object is taken by the python interpreter and creates
  indirect adress and this in Direct adresses is allocated to a variable called referance variable(e1)
  ex:- print(e1) -------> print's the adresses i,e. indirect adress

Useing referance variable we do following things:

---> We can put data into object
---> We can get the data from the object
---> we can call the methods using object
---> We can create 'n' of objects for a single class
---> Two different object same class also dosn't contain same indirect adress
